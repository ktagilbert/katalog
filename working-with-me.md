  <h4><strong>e-Newsletters</strong></h4>
    <p>
      I use Mailchimp to write creative, beautiful, and concise eNewsletters. I believe that the best newsletters show who you are. They are also short, sweet and to the point! So, don't waste your time. I'll write your message for you and send it to everyone you know! Services include one-off emails and drip campaigns.

  <h4><strong>Website Content</strong></h4>
    <p>
      My favorite task is creating website content. Your website content is arguable the most important part of your site. Your site should be easy to navigate, pretty, and, above all, communicate your missions and personality. So, let me tell your story! I'll make sure the content matches your company voice while directing people to where they need to go on your site.

    <div id="testimonial-1">
      "Creatives often have the reputation of being “lofty" or out of touch with real world business needs. Not Katie. Katie filled the role of Chief Content Officer on the creative team I managed at this agency. I hired her to tackle a large volume of ongoing social media management and website content projects. And I’m happy to say, she quickly got a potentially bad situation under control.
      Katie was able to quickly organize her workload and the workload of her internal and outsourced teams. This enabled her department to get project deadlines back on track, helping us maintain good client relationships. But the thing I, and I think the rest of the team, always appreciated the most was that she’s an absolute pleasure to work with!"<br/><br/> - Erik Schade

      "Katie exceeded my expectations when I hired her as our team's new SEO Specialist. Not only was she well versed in SEO and Social Media from the start, she also brought with her a background in web development and creative writing which makes her a rarity in the industry. I was also always impressed with her initiative and ability to step up and go the extra mile for the team. I look forward to seeing her advance in her career."<br/><br/> - Terry Schrimscher

    <div id="testimonial-3">
      "Katie volunteered on my committee for the 2015 MAX Awards and was a huge asset to our team. In all tasks, from sourcing flowers to updating our website, Katie was prompt, resourceful and eager to help. Katie never wavered in her commitment to the work and was truly an exemplary volunteer. Anyone who has the chance to work with her will see that her work ethic and ingenuity are second to none. I give Katie my highest recommendation."<br/><br/> - Lauren Sanders
