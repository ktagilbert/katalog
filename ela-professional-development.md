    How well students write is influenced by how they are taught to write.” ~ Steve Graham Makes sense, right?
  </h1>
    <p>
      How do we improve how we teach students to write? Is there a way to avoid our students entering remedial writing courses when they enter college? Similarly, how can we help them succeed in the job market using the best writing skills we can give them?

      The videos in this playlist are a starting point for teachers. They will touch on building literacy skills for ELL students, the value of creating writers' workshops in our schools, and how to help students develop their own, genuine academic voices.

          Three authors in the field of education, Steve Graham, Amy Gillespie, and Debra Mckeown, in a special issue of Reading and Writing, bring up a good point to consider. They write that educators are undervaluing writing. Meaning, they are putting reading skills above writing skills in terms of their classroom priorities and emphasis. But, it is not because they don’t care about writing. It is because they are still underprepared themselves to teach the skill to students.

          This sounds pretty insulting but in a research study by Sharlene A Kiurhara, Steve Graham, and Leanne Hawken, it was reported that only 51% of teachers agreed that their students would have the writing skills needed to complete college-level writing assignments. On top of that 71% of all teachers said they were received “minimal to no preparation to teach writing during their college preparation.

          In response, these authors argue that as teachers we need to  1) Understand why writing is important  2) Learn how writing develops. 3) Know how to teach writing. Their solution is to overhaul writing pedagogy. A big task. These authors argue that we can enact an overhaul by approaching Common Core States Standards (CCSS) in a way that adjusts standards to individual student needs in their classrooms.

          They suggest looking at scientific testing and practices of exemplary teachers for examples of how to properly teach writing skills to high schoolers. If they can do this while promoting flexibility, which has been found to be a key feature of proficient writers, and creating a supportive and motivating classroom environment, then they believe students can begin to become stronger writers within all subject areas.
