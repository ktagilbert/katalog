My new roommate knows that what I want to be a teacher and we got to talking about it yesterday. Somehow, books came up and we asked me if there were any books, as an English major, that really affected me. The answer was, yes! Holy shit, yes. Every quarter I found myself open-mouthed over the pages of some novel or other that my teacher had assigned to our class.

### The Dissapeared Chicano book

### Lolita

I read Lolita in my post-modern literature course my second year of undergrad. I wasn't enamored with the general plot of Nabakov's novel. I *was* over the mooon about his storytelling though!! So, yeah, it's about child pornography but not really. It is also a post-modern novel with an unreliable narrator who has an alter ego. He is writing from his jail cell and during his storytelling, he leaves little clues about his insanity and obsessions. It makes for an amazing read once you have a professor to point out all the tiny details. Nabakov then ends up challenging his readers to question their reading process, to look up his clues, to ask questions about his narrator, etc.

### Pride & Prejudice

### Stone Butch Blues
Leslie Feinberg is a damn brave soul. I'm kind of in love with her. Stone Butch Blues is her memoir and a wonderful coming of age story for anyone who feels like they can't be themselves - especially the LGBTQ. I read her memoir as a bi-sexual girl moving to Texas. I was feeling totally out of place in my new environment. More than that, I was feeling like I couldn't be myself. My sexuality wasn't out in the open among the people close to me back then. So, I kept it quiet all while reading about Leslie learning to come out, find love, and come into her own. What a wonderfully brave memoir. I only wish I had heeded her message to be yourself the first time I had read it.

### Folk

Did I ever tell you guys that I used to hate poetry? Yup, I was that kid dreading poetry month at school each year. It was all hokey and forced to me. Hmmm, what changed?

Well, I signed up to travel abroad to Ireland. More than anything, I wanted a big experience to help shake me up when I had signed up for the program. I kinda got my wish because a component of the experience was to read and write poetry. So, we read William Butler Yeats, Seamus Heaney, Oscar Wilde, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, and we had Tony Curtis as our guest professor in Ireland. He also came out to Washington for one class to talk about his book 'Folk'

Folk became the first collection of poetry I read. I remember being amazed that I loved it. Back then, I just loved the way his poems sounded. I read them all out loud once and then again to get the rhythm and cadence down. They came out lyrical and momentous this way.

I recently read the collection again and went crazy over it.  

### The Many Storied House

Read about it here! The Many Storied House throws down as my favorite poetry collection of all time. She tells a story through each of her poems and it makes for a beautiful, almost memoirist-ic, collection. I still remember that I read it when I had just moved into my new place at a coffee shop in my old neighborhood because I didn't know where else to go yet. I put on a nostalgic playlist, opened up the cover of Lyon's poems, and stayed at the coffee shop for hours. That was when I decided to write my own collection by the way. It's cliche but I was inspired.

### Cat's Cradle

Ready for pure craziness? Pick up Cat's Cradle and dive into the post-modern world of ice-nine, the Hoenniker family, and Bokononism.

### Norwegian Wood

### Lit
