### 'Big Magic' by Elizabeth Gilbert
![Big Magic Lit Blog Review](/katalog/assets/big-magic-elizabeth-gilbert.png)

I read 'Big Magic' over the course of my [New York trip](https://ktagilbert.github.io/katalog//2017/12/17/finding-time-to-reset.html). I ripped through it over the course of three days. *It is definitely a page-turner.*

Yet, it's not a beach read to take lightly. **Instead, 'Big Magic' helped me reframe my own creative mindset.**

I walked away with a few key lessons:

1. Creativity shouldn't be such a serious thing. Instead, it should just be fun and enjoyable. As Gilbert writes,
>"Let inspiration lead you wherever it wants to lead you. Keep in mind that for most of history people just made things, and they didn't make such a big freaking deal out of it. We make things because we *like* making things."

2. Continuing to be creative can be frustraing. For sure! Mostly because whatever we do at first isn't any good. But we just have to keep trying and trying until it improve. The same goes for working with drafts.

3. Creativity is essential. We have been creating arts as human beings for over forty thousand years. Art appeared on cave walls, carvings, and in the form of clay statuettes. We have had art, as Gilbert points out, for longer than we have agriculture. It is one of the oldest parts of our history!

4. We should be living the "trickster" lifestyle! As in, we should treat life as just a game. With that mindset, we can work to trick life - to find the fun and enjoyable among all the routine and mundane surrounding us. That will help us become more creative and just enjoy ourselves more. Sound great, right?

5. We should feel brave enough to pursue whatever interests us. We can be poets *and* non-fiction writers. Fiction authors *and* screenplay writers. We just need to follow out interests and not look back.


### 'Lit' by Mary Karr

![Lit by Mary Karr Review](/katalog/assets/lit-mary-karr.png)

'Time' wrote that "Karr seems to have been born with the inability to write a dishonest-or boring-sentence." *That is so goddamn true!* Mary Karr grew up in Texas and the crazy metaphors, exuberant language, and a lack of giving a fuck, totally comes out in her memoir. She just has a strong voice and it works really well in "Lit."

My first copy of 'Lit' is still packed away in Texas from when I lived in San Antonio. I was unable to pack all my books in a Subaru on my way to Portland. So, in lieu of getting those sent to me, I had to buy another copy of the memoir. **It is my favorite book, hands down.**

In the memoir, you at first follow Mary as she leaves her hometown in Texas (Note: read 'The Liar's Club) to learn more about that time of her life). Then, you see Mary get set off t0 college, begin her literary career, get married, have a child, and struggle with alcoholism all throughout.

What stands out is that sets out to accomplish three main things. She wants to create the idyllic family that she never had, she wants to become a reputable poet, and she seeks to outrun her mother's own destiny. As she writes,

>"I was seventeen, thin, and malleable as coast hanger wire, and Mother was the silky shadow stitched to my feet that I nonetheless believed I could outrun."

I think what I love most about "Lit" is Karr's brutal honesty. She depicts herself as objectively as a human being can without completely destroying their own sense of self worth. I can't even imagine how painful some of her stories were to recount. Yet, she gets them all down on the page in a way that tears at your heart strings.


### 'Splitting an Order' by Ted Kooser

### 'The Yellow Lighted Bookshop' by Lewis Buzbee
![The Yellow Lighted Bookshop Blog Review](/katalog/assets/yellow-lighted-bookshop.png)

Reading Lewis Buzbee's memoir was like meeting up with a new friend and realizing they share one of the same passions as you. Buzbee *loves* books and bookstores. He will go on his honeymoon and spend it looking for a certain shop that is sure to have a surprising paperback in store for him. He loves that bookstores are like living breathing cities. He loves the origin of the book and it's lifecycle from the publisher to the shelf and back.

I mean geeze, just read this quote:

>"Books, I knew then and now, give body to our ideas and imaginations, make them flesh in the world; a bookstore is the city where our fleshed-out inner selves reside."

My favorite part in Buzbee's novel is when he describes the excitement book lovers feel when they walk into a bookstore. It feels just like everytime I walk into a Powell's location, Elliot Bay Bookstore, or when I was traveling with mom in London and could wander to any cute little bookstore we found along our way.

You feel as if there is infinite possibilities. You could find a non-fiction that is so relatable it changes your though processes (I've so been there!). Better yet, you could find a poetry collection that inspires you to take more time to enjoy your surroundings or the people you love. I've even found seemingly random books that have opened me up to whole new areas of interest. A [novel about Radiohead](https://www.sheetmusicplus.com/title/exit-music-sheet-music/19581827?kw=&utm_medium=cpc&adpos=1o4&gclid=Cj0KCQiAyZLSBRDpARIsAH66VQLmHrmjlT2AG8UsXHpoP-4O3TNRGhde9SEtkFFzR1kukrAZ-4OM0cgaAorYEALw_wcB&d=sem_sidecar&d=sem_sidecar&popup=false&popup=false&utm_source=google&mkwid=s|pcrid|86117963782&ac=1&country_code=USA&sc_intid=19581827&scid=scplp19581827) was one such find.

Being in a bookstore is my favorite way to spend a weekend morning. Buzbee nails the feeling on the head when he explains that the feeling is like being both alone but connected to others - other reads (and other writers if you ask me).

I know you guys are readers, so if you want to spend hours connecting with a friend who shares your passion, definitely check out the Yellow Lighted Bookshop.


### 'Ariel' by Sylvia Plath
![Ariel, Poems by Sylvia Plath](/katalog/assets/sylvia-plath-ariel.png)

I read 'The Bell Jar' by Sylvia Plath back in August. From there, I was hooked! I went to the Powell's on Cedar Hills here and grabbed two different collections of poetry by Plath as well.

I read 'Ariel' first in September. I re-read it this month, giving me the chance to revisit her superb use of repetition, dark imagery, beautiful vocabulary, and radical enjambment.

Her collection is not just a bound book. It is her own heart laid out, stitched into signatures, and bound into a paperback. She writes about the struggle involved in living.

If you've ever experienced depression or dark thoughts, you will relate and leave this collection in awe of her ability to succinctly describe her feelings and in such a gorgeous way. I know I was in awe at least. 

***My favorite poems in the collection: Lady Lazarus, Elm, Lesbos, Medusa, a Birthday Present, The Munich Mannequins, Contusion***
