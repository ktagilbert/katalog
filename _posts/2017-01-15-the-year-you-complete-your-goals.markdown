What are your goals for 2017? Try asking yourself that question. Maybe get out a piece of paper and write down 3-10 goals while you're at it. I'll start.


### My Goals for 2017

1. I want to write consistently. Both on [Medium](https://medium.com/@KT_a_Gilbert) and here on Katalog.
2. In that vein, I want to begin work on a novel. Whether that be a fiction, non-fiction, or even a book of poetry. I don't know yet. Notice that I don't say I want to publish that novel. That will be a goal for next year.
3. Another writing goal! Wow, I sure want to write this year. I do want to get *something* published.
4. I want to [find some amazing clients](/working-with-me/) so that I can also continue doing the work that I love.
5. Learn how to drive stick-shift. Oh hey, a non-writing goal!
6. I want to save up for the perfect home desk.
7. I want to pay off my damn TV! The one I put on credit to help establish some credit. Now, I just want to finally stop paying that bill because hey, I have good credit now (yay!)

[Gordon Tredgold of Inc.com wrote something great](http://www.inc.com/gordon-tredgold/5-things-to-remember-when-setting-your-2017-goals.html) to keep in mind now that your goals are set. He says to remember that "just 0.3% progress each day will have you achieving your goal by mid-November!" So, with your goal list in front of you, it's time to commit to just working on each of these a little each day. That way, you may even achieve them before the year is over.

I'll be doing the same. I'm starting a bit late though because I never actually made any New Year's resolutions. Realizing that this morning, I set aside some time to focus on what it is I want to accomplish in 2017. Then, I decided to tackle just one of my goals this morning.

As you can see in my list above, I want to start writing consistently. Which, I'm not going to lie, is terrifying to me! I'm not talking about content marketing though. I'm talking about personal writing projects that live outside of my work and this blog. Now, this is a goal that has been swimming around in my head for *months*. Yet, each day I avoid working on a personal writing project. It has honestly been driving me insane.

Deciding that I can't keep driving myself crazy with the idea of a goal, I decided to make it a real, concrete plan that I'll commit to every day. I started this morning with a simple writing prompt.

#### Committing to Your Goals
Are you motivated yet? Excited to start working toward your goals in 2017? Maybe you want to start eating a healthier breakfast five days a week or, even better, you want to [improve your content writing chops](/2016/12/26/how-to-improve-your-copywriting-workflow.html). Okay then, let's make it happen!

#### How to Achieve Your Resolutions

**Make it visual.** I don't really believe in vision boards. That's just me and I'm not knocking anyone else who does. I'm just not a visual learner and I believe that vision boards only work for those that do best with visual cues. If that's you, then a vision board might be the perfect route to take. That way you can keep your goals in mind each day. Just make sure to put your visual reminders somewhere you see on a daily basis. That could be above your desk, in the kitchen, or next to your bedroom mirror. Alternatively, you could list out your goals and put them on your fridge or the first page of your daily planner.

**Track your progress.** Writing down how you're achieving goals can help more than you think. It might seem tedious. Yet, the simple act of writing down how you worked toward your larger dreams this year can help you keep your goals as a priority.

**Invest in yourself.**: In the words of [Moly Cain](http://www.forbes.com/sites/glassheel/2013/03/14/6-ways-to-achieve-any-goal/2/#4a7b6f593c71), "*thereâ€™s only one person in this goal-setting process that matters. You."*

**Don't get distracted.** I would say avoiding distraction is the best tip you could follow. So, *if you remember anything from this article, remember this one!* Your goals should be your number one priority. I mean, you set them so that you could work toward expanding your capabilities. To become more fulfilled, live out a dream, or to finally see some progress toward an even larger goal. Your goals are obviously important to you. So repeat after me, "I will not forget about these goals!" Dishes, social media, T.V., all that can wait. More importantly, daily errands will not stop you from making your larger goals in 2017 a priority. You can think about it this way, if you need to take 20 minutes away from the family to work toward something that's important to you, then that is okay. You'll be happier you took that time for yourself so that you return to your family recharged and more present.

Alright, now that you're all excited to begin working toward those resolutions it's time to start taking action. **I'd love to hear about any of your progress or even see what goals you'll be working toward.** Let me know in the comments.

Until then, I'll be sure to keep you posted on how I'm working toward my own goals here. Be sure to check back or even just read some of my [daily writing prompts over on Medium](https://medium.com/@KT_a_Gilbert).
