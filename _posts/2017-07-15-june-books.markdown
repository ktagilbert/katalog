### The Many Storied House by George Ella Lyon
It starts with the picture of a mid-century two-story house. It's "reddish brown and white. You can't miss it." Similarly, you can't miss out on this collection if you're a fan of poetry. Lyon open the rest of the collection by introducing us to the floor plans of the home. Starting with the downstairs,  there are four main rooms and two porches. The first poem begins right at front door. You then get to explore the house and it's history through lyrical, free-form poems, which are right up my alley!

Lyon's poems are relatable thanks to the inclusion of familial details that anyone who has been a part of a family, functional or dysfunctional, would happily recall. She mentions using a bathroom window to squeeze a kid through when you lock yourself out of the house, small tragedies like a radio breaking, and playing king of the hill with the neighbor kids,

The best part though is that Lyon makes you work to decipher her life stories through depictions of the home and all it houses: memories, family, heirlooms, and all.

You learn about her sick Dad and Great-Grandmother. Strict mom, six siblings, and a home to house them all. Some poems are as short a three lines - describing just a moment that helps define those that lives in the story-home. Others are long and meandering meditations on the events that took place inside the home.

**My Favorite Poems in the Collection: That Chair, Phone, Half, [Untitled], Cliff, Final Play, The Day After**

### What We Talk About When We Talk About Love by Raymond Carver
I picked up my copy of What We Talk About When We Talk About Love a little over two years ago at Powell's Books. I had heard it was some of the best short stories you can read. Plus, I'm a sucker for love. A friend once told me "Katie, you love love," and you know what, they were right. I love reading about relationships and learning from the small gestures of the characters how others chose to express romantic emotions or what exactly goes into the beginning and endings of relationships. There's just something about the subject of love that gets my mind hooked.

Carver's stories were definitely not disappointing then. Starting with the first story, we see a young couple meet an older man seemingly coming out of his own relationship. He's selling the remnants of that relationship at a garage sale when the young couple approach him to haggle down the worth of those romantic remnants. They explicity undervalue the worth of everything he's selling. Instead of being hurt by it, though, the character chooses to literally dance in the moment. He puts on some music and invites the couple to dance on his lawn - something both of them have never done before. As if in a dream, the characters take the invitation.

The rest of the stories follow suit. The sentences and paragraphs are short and to the point. Plus, Carver has a unique ability to make the reader do almost all of the work to find the meaning behind them. He definitely never tells you the moral. Instead, he leaves you to draw the meaning out while savoring the small snapshots of adult love.
I think Empty Mirror actually says it best.

> "Textually, the stories are light and easy to read, yet they raise complex philosophical questions for the reader about the nature of modern life and love." - via [Empty Mirror Books](http://www.emptymirrorbooks.com/reviews/what-we-talk-about-raymond-carver.html)

### A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway

All Hemingway fans will appreciate the characteristic short, too the point sentences and the strictly factual, yet still descriptive, prose. The novel is split up into books that each beginning with vivid yet strangely taciturn descriptions of the setting that Tenente (a.k.a. Henry) is in.

The rest of the novel is also characteristically about war. Tenente is a numb to the world lieutenant in the Italian army during World War I. He doesn't see the point in the war. To the point that he wonders if it is better to be defeated in the war or to surrender. Either way, it will end but either you will lose. The questions speaks to how hopeless he feels about the whole situation. This attitude is carried over into his feelings about love and life as well it seems. He does gain a romantic partner but, without giving anything away, the relationships is forced or almost maternal throughout.

Along with a gripping plot, A Farewell to Arms has you thinking long and hard about your own relationships with others as you follow Tenente navigating through the end of World War I and the beginning of his first experience with love. You'll notice that all of his relationships are similarly contrived and he is not always truthful with everyone. Instead, he seems to be swimming against the current via drinking and friends to get to a place free of pain.
