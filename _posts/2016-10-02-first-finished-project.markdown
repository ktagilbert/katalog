I decided to improve as a knitter about two weeks ago. But I didn't want to just dive in. So I scoured Pinterest for an easy project.  I couldn't really find the perfect thing but I did stumble on a bunch of headbands that looked like fun to make.

I just wanted something that I would for sure wear. That meant no fancy twists, cables that would make my head looker bigger, etc. So in the end I skipped using a pattern. Instead, I went into the bin of yarn and needles that I keep in the laundry room and found some soft, pink merino wool and some thin bamboo needles (sorry I forgot the size already!). I also found some wooden button I had ordered back in January so I decided I wanted to use these too.

My goal was just to create a near-perfect headband that I could wear in the Fall and Winter this year. So I sat at my armchair and began knitting while my boyfriend, John watched Top Gear. What I discovered is that I'm pretty bad at knitting and talking at the same time. Mistakes starting piling up right away and so I began again and then again.

Eventually, I had to move to another room where I could concentrate on what I was doing. I started the project over about 3 times that first day. But oh well. Once I actually got started, the project went by pretty fast.

I completed the headband over about 3 days. I knitted half of it the first day and then had to stop early that day because my fingers weren't used to the repetitive movements. I finished the rest of the length the next weekend. Then, I finally grabbed the project back up this morning to sew in the buttons and weave in the ends. Now, I I have to say **I love** the finished product!

I think I'm going to wear this today to help hold my hair in place under my raincoat hood. It will also be good for chilly mornings when I'm talking out Mel, my Border Collie, and then walking to the car for work.

I'm definitely excited that this project is complete because it really is one of the more well-made accessories I have made so far. It helped that I frogged every mistake I noticed and kept my tension pretty even throughout the whole project. The only thing is that I made my button holes a bit too big so I had to go back and sew them smaller. which ruined how neat they had looked. But oh well. No one is going to notice when the headband is buttoned up anyway.  

## How to Make the Headband

I'm going to call this one the Woodland Dreams Headband because the wood buttons and deep pink color make it look like something I would dream of wearing while out camping in the woods. So, without further ado, this how you can make your own Woodland Dreams Headband.

- Grab 1 skein of angora merino yarn. I used [this kind from Lion Brand](http://www.lionbrand.com/yarn/lb-collection-angora-merino-yarn.html).
- Use whatever size of straight, needles you think will be appropriate. As I said, I already forgot the size I used but if I had to guess, I think I used a pair of US size 8 straight needles.
- Work 17 stitches in moss stitch (knit one, purl one) until the headband measure the circumference of your head -1 inch.
- For the last inch of your project, create 2 button holes and then cast off your stitches
- Sew on your buttons and then try on your new headband!

*** One Note:*** consider having a knitting kit by your side while working. Mine is pictured above and it saved my butt more than a couple of times while working on this headband. The kit I used was even pretty cheap. [I got it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Outop-Basic-Knitting-Accessories-Supplies/dp/B00L8KLLCW/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1475424675&sr=8-5&keywords=knitting+kit) for just $6.50 and I would have gladly payed twice that honestly for how much value it has given me so far.

Now that my headband is done it's time to move on to the next thing. I'll be working on the jasmine scarf for the next couple of weeks. I'll keep you updated while I struggle through the new pattern. I'm sure I'll be starting this one over at least a few times! **Until then, thank you for reading guys!**
