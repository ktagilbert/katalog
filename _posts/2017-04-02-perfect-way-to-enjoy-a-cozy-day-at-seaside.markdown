This week, I am on a little at-home vacation. Meaning, I have time all to myself! To make the most of my week off, I'm trying find a balance between productivity and just enjoying myself (while also not ruining my bank account).

To start my vacation out, I took Friday afternoon to do a little shopping, which I never, ever do. I only picked up three things but even just getting out and looking at all the cute spring clothes made me happy. There are so many cute florals and stripe patterns out this year. I'm also a total sucker for florals. So, surprise, surprise, I walked away with two floral tops and a floral print sundress.

**The next day, I decided to get out of my town and head to the beach!** Having that plan made waking up in the morning exciting. I planned my outfit the night before to help eliminate some stress the next day, straightened my hair to prevent the frizz that's inevitable at the Oregon Coast, packed my bag, and headed out!

# How to Make the Most of a Trip to Seaside, Oregon

1. **Choose the right outfit.** The most important part of my planning process was honestly what I wore. I'm not a huge fashionista but I do like to look like I've put effort into my appearance. So, to make sure I would feel good about my outfit and still be practical, I opted for layers.

  *I wore a floral tank top (pictured above), a grey, wool, sweater, soft medium-wash jeans, ankle boots to help keep my feet dry from puddles, a raincoat, and a knit beanie.* The only thing I should have worn is contacts but I ran out of those months ago! Meaning, my glasses were covered in rain drops from the mist that day. Oh well!

2. **Pack Light** There is nothing worse than lugging around a huge bag when you're out exploring a new town. I kept my own bag pretty simple. I brought a book, a notebook, my wallet, my makeup bag, and a spare scarf in case it was super cold. *That's it!* I kept a water bottle in my car as well plus, my keys and phone that both stayed in my coat pocket. My purse was never heavy and I had everything I needed to enjoy my day.

3. **Plan where you'll go.** I've taken *so* many trips where I didn't plan ahead. The end result is that you wander around and kind of just look at things aimlessly. Or, you inevitably fill your day with food and candy. Instead, I wanted my trip to be filled with things I wouldn't usually take the time to do. Wit that in mind, I did some Googling the night before and found just a couple of things I definitely wanted to fit in.

  **If you're looking for things to do at Seaside Beach, I definitely recommend visiting the Seaside Coffee House.** I spent the morning there in a plush, wide arm chair with a 20 oz. cafe au lait, a good book, and a view of the sleepy little town. I loved it because everyone there was a regular and I got to kind of just take a peak into their world.

4. **Leave early but not too early.** It's my extinct to wake up at 6:00 a.m. and just head out when I'm going on a trip. That's not really practical for a trip to Seaside though. The shops don't open until 10:00 or 11:00 a.m. Meaning, you'll have just the coffee shops available to you and about 10 blocks of things to explore before the store owners open their doors.

  I left my place at around 7:40 a.m. and drove for 1.5 hours after stopping for a drive-through breakfast and the gas station. I got there at about 9:30 and enjoyed my cozy coffee shop morning until 11:00 a.m. Plus, I only ended up using a quarter tank of gas for the whole day so, I could have saved myself some more time by skipping the gas station.

5. **Get Away From the Crowds.** At Seaside, there will be a lot of tourists right on Broadway St. They're all polite and having fun so, it's no big deal. It's just sometimes nice to break away from the crowd so that you can really enjoy your time at the beach.

  Because it was too wet to really enjoy the sandy shore, I oped to go check out the river that runs through the town. It has a little boardwalk/bridge with benches where you can sit and enjoy the view. I chose to walk around the entire thing and then to sit on a bench and write a little bit. There were people down below canoeing and river boating too if that's more your speed. The experience, though, reminded me a lot of the San Antonio River Walk. It was like the PNW version of it though. It was cloudy and chilly but still beautiful!

### The Joys of Getting Away

I have never been able to just set out like this before by the way. I've only had a car for about a year but was never very comfortable driving on the highway until a few months ago. *To eat a greasy bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit with one hand on the wheel while cruising out of town was an amazing feeling!* I get why so many American stories are about road trips now. You really do get to just get out of yourself when you set out like that.

Now, I'm feeling more refreshed and ready to enjoy the rest of my vacation this week. I'll be working on a little DIY this week that I'll be sure to share here. Plus, I'll be looking for some new bedroom decorations to complete my desk space. Other than that, I have some work to get done and a lot of walks to take to help get me out of the house.
