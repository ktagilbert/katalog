I have some exciting news to *finally* share with you today.

You know how in [my last post](https://ktagilbert.github.io/katalog//2017/07/15/june-books.html) I let you know that I began work on my own collection of poetry? Well, I really got to work and started writing just a bunch of poems. I couldn't stop reading poetry, or even writing it, (which I wish I could still say this week! Where did all the inspiration go?).

Eventually, I also reached for another one of my goals this year: to get published.

Long story short, I took a four week class at the [Attic Institute](http://atticinstitute.com/) back in July titled 'So You Wanna Be a Writer.' Yes, I know, I studied Creative Writing but I felt like this class would be the perfect way to get my feet wet in the writing world again since graduating.

The teacher turned me on to to Poets & Writers, which has [a huge list of publishers](https://www.pw.org/small_presses) for writers to check out. Definitely go see what it's all about if you haven't already by the way!

From there, I began researching publications where some of my poems from class would be a good fit. *I ended up submitting a couple from class and a couple that I wrote outside of class during the summer.*

**Finally, after weeks of waiting, I got an email after work that one of my poems was accepted by a digital magazine.** That's the short version of this story. I was in my car about to hit the road but wanted to check my email first.

The news was at the bottom of my inbox, I almost skipped over it, and when I *did* read it, I just started screaming and 'whooo-ing' while driving down the highway like a total nerd. **It was amazing: a literal dream come true to have a poem be published.**

Now, I'm just waiting for the magazine to launch the next volume and then I'll be able to share the actual poem with you guys. In the meantime, I can share the headshots that my amazing friend [Ericka](http://www.erickanicolephotography.com/) took for me so that I would have something to send to the magazine. Take a look and [be sure to follow her](https://www.instagram.com/erickanicolephotography/)!

Taking these photos was a terrifying prospect. Thankfully, Ericka put me right at ease and I even started having fun.

I also have a little ditty that I wrote just for fun one morning. You can read below (just in case you were curious about the poetry I keep rattling on about):

### Still Dreaming During a Morning Meeting

##### I want to stay flannel covered and spindly as a cat
##### in bed. Beneath each row of cabled yarn
##### worked together as carefully
##### as when you say a prayer over beads.

##### Let these comforts be my coworkers today.
##### I’ll do the work and meet them halfway
##### above the hug of a cotton quilt, white
##### as a newborn’s first gaze,

##### I’ll rise, I promise, but only to greet a book
##### and pen as clients to a meeting. We’ll convene.
##### Not about hours worked or the data behind productivity.

##### No numbers or tables, only words printed
##### and my pen beneath each finished poem -
##### still dreaming.
