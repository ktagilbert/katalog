 I'm back in the swing of things now. Or, I'm trying to be.  Plus, I'm trying, *trying*, to read more, get back into living for poetry (reading and writing), and taking some time for physical activity.

So, I recently started reading [The Know it All](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28116.The_Know_It_All) by AJ Jacobs. Jacobs, to start with, is awesome. I would totally love to be out a bar with friends talking to him. Anyway, he goes on a quest to read the Encyclopedia Brittanica from A-Z.

That sounds super boring. In fact, I picked up the book back in 2015 and I didn't read it until now because it did some kind of boring even after I had bought it. (So why did I buy it again?) But, as soon as I got past his section on "A," I was hooked.

I'm now up to "H" in his journey through the Brittanica. So far, I've learned that the term "going berserk" comes from Norse soldiers "who," it is said went into battle naked. Hence 'going berserk.'That and elves were originally conceived as creatures that sat on your chest while you slept to give you bad dreams.

All of these facts are super fun. My only issue is that Jacobs flagrantly flaunts/relies on stereotypes and incredibly non-pc remarks to add humor to a lot of his anecdotes.

I'm definitely not a fan and even more so that he, and his publisher, don't hesitate to use these stereotypes for comic relief from all the content about obscure facts.

Still, I relate to Jacobs a lot. Primarily because I love collecting facts and anecdotes as well. Sadly, I rely on the phrase, "did you know" way to often and someone other than me should definitely call me out on it.

Here's the thing, though: I love learning. So, I spend a lot of my weekends taking walks while listening to the Ted Radio Hour. That, or I'm reading the Book Review, Education, and Style sections of the New York Times (only because they are left in my apartment lobby every weekend. Thank you Landlord!!).

# This Week's Roundup

##The New York Times Book Review Section

### Locking Her Up
###What Happened to thousands of women suspected of having sexually transmitted diseases?

They had police capture women with STDs!!! And it was more of a witch hunt. Many didn't even have a disease. They were just taken away and put into concentration camps to, you know, keep men safe.

As part of the American Plan, author Nina McCall tells us about America's "social hygiene" campaign. This was all pre-penicillin. Instead, doctors injected these women with mercury and other arsenic related chemicals. The effects included loosened teeth and hair loss among others.

The baddass part is that some of these women chose to wrap up their guards in their bedsheets. They then hurled their guards out of their windows so they could make their escapes. Hell yeah!

###Science of Quakery
####Hormone research and its many missteps and mistakes

S, get this. Doctors back in the day would perform experimental surgeries on children without their parents' consent. One that Naomi Oreskes points out from Randi Hutter Epsteins books, The History of Hormones and How They Control Just About everything, is that a doctor transitioned 17-month old baby boy into a girl. Like what the hell?

Apparently the author also seems to delight in these accounts. Oreskes writes, "Even more disturbing then reading about these practices that for the most part Epstein shrugs them off, saying that the physicians involved were well intentioned, that what they did was appropriate for their day or they they did what they could the information they had." Hmm, yeah sure...

##The New York Times Style Section

###Deeper Voice, More Listeners
Thomas Page McBee helps share a 31-year-old trans mans account of becoming male. The first thing this man noticed was that his voice could silence any room he was in. People would lean toward him eager to here more as he spoke. Even he was just stumbling through a thought out loud.

He noticed the problem and so he relied on women to help him become a more fair speaker. he asked for feedbad on how to be a better boss, co-worker, partner, and friend.

He learned to highlight women's accomplishments during meetings, to have round-table discussions where everyone got a chance to speak, and to take on some of the totally invisible work women do around the office. Which, geeze, I've felt obligated to do WAY TOO MANY TIMES. Including, organizing holiday parties, loading and unloaded the office dishwasher, and refilling the paper towels on the roll in the kitchen. He also learned to ask for help and learn from others as he went about his day instead of talking as if he knew all of the answers and the women around him did not.

What a refreshing reminder that women are overlooked even in small ways. These are micro and macro agressions that I love to see being called out.

###The Future of Dating Is...Old-School Personal Ads?

Yup! Kelly Rakowski publishes personal ads geared toward "lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer, intersex, and asexual women; and gender-nonconforming and non-binary people. (Jamie Lauren Keiles, NYT). These ads appear on her Instagram account, "Personals." Go search for the page because it's awesome (and that's what I did right away).

People send in their personal ads. Then, once a month, they are published on the page with tags showing who submitted them. If anyone is interested, they can contact the author directly. Cool, right? Makes me want a Pina Colada and to get caught in the rain.

Kelly Rakowski also created Herstory - another awesome Instagram page. It shows lesbian imagery from throughout history. Plus, she's the photo editor for Metropolis Magazine. In short, she's super ambitious and creative!

## The New York Times Learning section

### When School Gets Real

This article take a unique form. I starts by asking "How do you connect what you're learning in the classroom with what's going on in the world outside of school?" Over 1,200 teanager answered. The same question was posed to teachers and they also had a lot to say!

Out of the answers, a few really caught my attention:

- An 18-year-old says Brave New World helped her see how rampant consumerism and our need for instant gratification is harmful to society. Hell yeah! What a smart student.

- A teacher in Brooklyn also submitted a great answer. He has his eight-graders choose an injustice that happening today that they would like to learn more about *and* take action toward solving.

Apparently his students have created Instagram accounts about our strict beauty standards and musical fundraised for LGBTQ+ rights group. Some have also created artwork, creative writing pieces, and written political letters about police brutality and mass incarcertation. I would totally steal this lesson idea for my own classroom by the way.
