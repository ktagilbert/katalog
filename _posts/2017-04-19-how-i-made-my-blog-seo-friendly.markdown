I started made my blog here in October 2016. At first, I focused just on creating a pretty design and the goal of having a creative project to do after work. Soon, though, I had four pages, some social media links, and few pre-written posts. It looked great to me so it was super tempting to launch it right away. But I had to hold myself back. I still had a few more technical things to think about.

You know the cliche, "showing up is half the battle"? Okay, it's corny, but showing up is truly the half the battle when it comes to your blog. By that I mean showing up on search engines. It's not enough to just have a blog. You want to make sure that it shows up when someone runs a search and that search engines aren't penalizing your site for some natural mistakes. For me, it took until December to get on top of those technical things.

# How to Start Making Your Blog SEO Friendly

I'm a former SEO Specialist (now general digital marketer). So, admitting that SEO came last for my blog here is kind of embarrassing. At the same time, SEO does usually come last on a website's pre-launch checklist. So at least I was able to refrain from launching my site before tackling the few things I needed to do to make my site SEO friendly.

**In this post, I'll help you do the same by showing you the steps I took to make this site indexable by search engines, how I was able to do it, and what tools I used (including some free ones I'll be giving away for you!)**


### Make an Editorial Calendar

The best thing you can do to make your site successful is by focusing on your content. That means you should continue to write awesome posts on a regular basis. Just rememember to also include some on-page SEO measures to make sure those posts get found. Namely, remember that **each post your write should have a keyword that you use in your post's title, meta descriptions, h1 headers, and in the post. content itself.**

For this blog, I use a Google sheet to help me both plan out my topics and prepare some of these more technical things ahead of time. That way, I can just focus on writing my posts without worrying about anything else later on.

You can do the same with this [free blog editorial calendar sheet](/downloads/blog-editorial-calendar). Plus, once you have a month to three months worth of content planned out, you can start pre-writing you content so that you can take a worry-free vacation down the road!

#### Why Your Content is Important
- People are sick of constant promotions, cold-calls, sales, and ads. It becomes literal white noise after a while. Yet, they [naturally crave stories](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/can-science-explain-why-we-tell-stories)!
- Content helps you relate and build a relationship with your target audience.
- Each post your write can be repurposed, re-shared, or re-leveraged so you can continue to earn new leads or engagement.
- Well researched content can establish you as a thought leader in your industry or niche.
- Each post your write counts as a new page that can be indexed be Google. Meaning, you'll have more opportunities to be found when readers run a search!
- You can use your content as an additional tool to help direct people to a landing page offer and thank you page that will take them further into the ![buyer's journey](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey).

### Use Alt Text
Alt text is another way to show search engines that what your content is about. You can add alt text to your images by using the keyword for your page or post. It helps prove that your content is relevant to search engines *and* it helps searchers find your posts when they run an image search.

I use unique alt text for every image on my site here. Plus, I make sure to add my site name to each of my original pictures to help increase my brand awareness (and to make sure no one claims my pictures for their own).

### Create a Sitemap
A sitemap is pretty often overlooked so no worries if you haven't done this yet! Still, you're going to want one because it helps establish your content as solely your own content. That way you can avoid being penalized for duplicate content on the off chance that someone copies your content. Plus, it sitemaps let you tell search engines when you add new content so that it can be indexed faster and you can show up on search engine result pages (SERPs) more quickly.

To submit your sitemap, make sure you create a [Google Search Console account](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en&pli=1) and then find the word "Crawl" on the left sidebar menu. Here, you'll go to "Sitemap" and select the orange "Add/Test Sitemap" button.


### Create a robots.txt File

A robots.txt file is good for a few reasons. If you have a page with very little content on it (like a Thank You Page), that Google is going to see as useless, you can tell Google not to crawl it. Basically, you tell Google not to judge you for that content.

You can also use a robots.txt file if you don’t think a page reflects well on your site. That way you won’t be penalized for pages that aren’t well optimized.


### Clear Navigation
Nothing can hurt your bounce rates more than a menu that isn't well designed. I'm sure you've been to a site where you couldn't find the menu or a page you're looking for. Inevitably, you just get annoyed and leave the site (or bounce away). That's why a simple menu that is clear and easy to use on both desktops and mobile devices is so important!

Thankfully, Wordpress sites handle the menu issue for you so you don't need to worry. Just make sure you don't have a million tabs for each menu item and you should be good to go. If you made your site yourself, like me, my best advice is to go for simple over anything fancy when it comes to your menu.

### Solid Mobile Design
Late last year it was [reported that there were officially more mobile users than desktop users online](http://bgr.com/2016/11/02/internet-usage-desktop-vs-mobile/) during a month. I seriously remember exactly where I was when that I saw the headline for that article by the way. It's just quickly becoming true that people are on their phone more often than they're on a computer. So, you website should naturally look good on both platforms.

For my site, I created the mobile design first. Again, many Wordpress themes make it easy to tackle the mobile design issue. To help though, make sure you consider the mobile version of your theme before you commit to one.

### Install Google Analytics
In the words of Nike and Shia LaBoeouf, Just Do It! It's super simple and it will help you see who is coming to your site, what is working on your site, and how you are acquiring new traffic. If you want to grow your site or blog, Google Analytics will be your best friend to help you create a strategy to do so.
