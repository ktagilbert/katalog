  Hi, everyone. Welcome!
</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Katie Gilbert. I am a teacher candidate at Portland State University, set to graduate in June 2020. Here, I am compiling some sample unit and lesson ideas for high school secondary language arts students. Explore and definitely checkout the available teacher and student resources here on the site.

  Resources to build and improve writing & reading skills
</h2>
<p>
  As I am continuing in the Graduate Teacher Education Program (GTEP) at Portland State University (PSU), I have put a large focus on teaching writing skills to high school level students.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, a major problem for college-bound high school seniors today is that they are underprepared for college writing tasks. In fact, statistics from NAEP and Achieve, Inc. state that 77% of 12th-grade students did not meet NAEP writing proficiency goals, 1/3 of high school students do not meet the benchmarks for college-level composition courses (2003), and 50% are estimated to be unprepared for college-level writing demands (2005).
</p>
<p>
  How did this happen and what do we do about it?
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    This section of the website will provide ways to change these statistics by providing professional development videos, sample lessons and units, and a range of resources to help teach literacy and writing skills using tech in the classroom.
